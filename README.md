## What it does
Firstly, ParkCar Chill can help drivers check the real-time availability of the closest on-street parking spots and find the optimal way to be navigated to their destination once they set it through text or voice recognition button.

Secondly, Drivers don’t need to get our of their car to search for Pay station to pay for parking fees that all the payment will be deducted automatically online. All they need to do is just to top up their balance.

Thirdly, we have fantastic parking expiry alert system to remind drivers in order to avoid unnecessary parking fines. In the other hand, it gonna help government decrease the human cost of hiring fines instructors as all the fine information can be accessed online provided by our technologies. Moreover, it will contribute to a smarter city as the traffic in the city can be possibly decreased once most of the drivers can find their parkings quickly.

## How we built it
We use React for Front End with Google Cloud Platform's APIs. Backend is with AWS services to form a serverless architecture.

## Challenges we ran into
Technically, we can help drivers book their parking spots online. But in reality, it might not gonna work well as there are so many scenarios in the real traffic settings. For example, what if the drivers who booked the on-street parking spot on our app won’t show up? How would we gonna really help the drivers secure the parking just only by clicking on the button? Are we allowed to block the parking spots as they are the public properties of city of Melbourne? How are we gonna balance their interests well between different stakeholders?

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully managed to created the prototype and it’s functional. With our current web app, we can help the drivers nevigate the optimal way to the closest parking spot and count the parking time. Moreover, we have been through the user journey map as well for different testing and scenarios.
